Hi all! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Snehasis, a researcher in sustainable computing. Currently, I am a PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'> University of Massachusetts-Amherst</a> in <a href='https://lass.cs.umass.edu/'> Laboratory for Advanced System Software</a> working with <a href='(https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/)'>Prof. Prashant Shenoy</a> and <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~phuc/'>Prof. VP Nguyen</a> on problems related to the embedded carbon footprint of computing systems. My research looks into the embedded carbon footprint of computing systems, with the goal of developing more sustainable technologies. Broadly, Iâ€™m interested in designing systems that balance performance, efficiency, and environmental impact by applying the principles of reuse, reduce, and recycle.

As far as my background goes, I hold a thesis-based M.Sc. degree from the University of Calgary, where I studied coding theory and implemented new error-correction codes for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), focusing particularly on polar codes (you can find my thesis <a href='https://prism.ucalgary.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/20a187d9-ee2e-4e31-acc8-e6622e5a546d/content'>here</a>). Prior to that, I graduated from IIT Dhanbad in 2021, receiving a B.Tech. in ECE.

Beyond research, I enjoy playing racquet sports, primarily tennis and squash, and exploring the culinary art of Indian cuisine. Additionally, I'm an avid fan of winter sports, especially ice skating and the occasional skiing adventure.
