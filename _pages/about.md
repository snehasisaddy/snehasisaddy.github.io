Hi all! I'm Snehasis, a quantum researcher working beyond the boundaries of a single discipline. Currently, I am a PhD student at <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'> University of Massachussetts-Amherst</a> working with <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/rozpedek-filip'>Prof. Filip RozpÄ™dek</a> and <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/vardoyan-gayane'>Prof. Gayane Vardoyan</a> on topics related to quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. 
#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

As far as my background goes, I have been professionally trained in different disciplines. I hold a thesis-based M.Sc. degree in Physics from the University of Calgary, where I specialized in implementing new error-correction codes for Quantum Key Distribution, focusing particularly on Polar codes (you can find my thesis [here][https://prism.ucalgary.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/20a187d9-ee2e-4e31-acc8-e6622e5a546d/content]). Prior to that, I graduated from IIT Dhanbad in 2021, receiving a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
