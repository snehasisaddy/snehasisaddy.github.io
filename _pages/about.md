Hi all! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Snehasis, a quantum researcher working beyond the boundaries of a single discipline. Currently, I am a PhD student at <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'> University of Massachussetts-Amherst</a> working with <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/rozpedek-filip'>Prof. Filip RozpÄ™dek</a> and <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/vardoyan-gayane'>Prof. Gayane Vardoyan</a> on topics related to quantum networks and distributed quantum computing. Overall I am passionate about research in developing large-scale quantum networks and am excited to be a part of the next quantum revolution.

As far as my background goes, I have been professionally trained in different disciplines. I hold a thesis-based M.Sc. degree in Physics from the University of Calgary, where I specialized in implementing new error-correction codes for Quantum Key Distribution, focusing particularly on Polar codes (you can find my thesis <a href='https://prism.ucalgary.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/20a187d9-ee2e-4e31-acc8-e6622e5a546d/content'>here</a>). Prior to that, I graduated from IIT Dhanbad in 2021, receiving a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Beyond quantum research, I enjoy playing racquet sports, primarily tennis and squash, and exploring the culinary art of Indian cuisine. Additionally, I'm an avid fan of winter sports, especially ice skating and the occasional skiing adventure.
