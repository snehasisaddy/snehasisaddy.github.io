Hi all! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Snehasis, a second-year PhD student at the <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'> University of Massachusetts-Amherst</a>. I work in the <a href='https://lass.cs.umass.edu/'> Laboratory for Advanced System Software</a> working with <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/'>Prof. Prashant Shenoy</a> and <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~phuc/'>Prof. VP Nguyen</a>. My interests broadly lie in the area of **Neuromorphic Wearable Technology**, with a focus on applications such as **Health Sensing**, **Energy efficient sensing**, **Internet of Things**, and **Ubiquitous Computing**. My current research looks into developing neuromorphic-based sensing systems to advance wearable health monitoring technologies.

As far as my background goes, I hold a thesis-based M.Sc. degree from the University of Calgary, where I studied coding theory and implemented new error-correction codes for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), focusing particularly on polar codes (you can find my thesis <a href='https://prism.ucalgary.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/20a187d9-ee2e-4e31-acc8-e6622e5a546d/content'>here</a>). Prior to that, I graduated from IIT Dhanbad in 2021, receiving a B.Tech. in ECE.

Beyond research, I enjoy playing racquet sports, primarily tennis and squash, and exploring the culinary art of Indian cuisine. Additionally, I'm an avid fan of winter sports, especially ice skating and the occasional skiing adventure.
