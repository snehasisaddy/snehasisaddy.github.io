In this project, we design a privacy amplification module for QKD.

---
Some highlights of this project are:
- Designed a Toeplitz matrix as a universal hash function.
- Extracted a secret key from a weak secure key (key generated after error correction) using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique.
