In this project, we designed the LDPC encoder using a parity check matrix and the LDPC decoder using the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. Using this we successfully performed error correction on an experimental QKD dataset.

---
Some highlights of the projects are:
- Designed an algorithm to find the parity check matrix needed to generate syndrome.
- Designed a complete interface to handle error correction (encoding and decoding) in a binary symmetric channel with different error rates.

The code for this project has not yet been released.
